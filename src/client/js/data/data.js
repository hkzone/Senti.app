  `Worst service ever at this HSBC branch in Causeway Bay. Clerk made me go to the bank back and forth 3 times to open my bank account and after 30 minutes of procedure, even if at the begining he told me that I had all of the documents requested, I was unable to open my bank account as I was missing a document....seriously???`,
  `The only good thing  was the price. The taste and feel wasn't good at all. Avoid getting they average cakes for a birthday, you'll be disappointed!`,
  `I am very impressed by the food. The pork knuckle with sauerkraut was outstanding. It's skin is super crispy and the fattiness from the pork was well balanced by the sauerkraut. The flavours almost took me back to Germany. The whole dish was quite big in portion which can be easily shared by 3-4 people. The pasta with clams and chrozio was very savoury but a tad too spicy. The waiters were very polite and attentive.`,
