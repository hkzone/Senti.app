  `Worst service ever at this HSBC branch in Causeway Bay. Clerk made me go to the bank back and forth 3 times to open my bank account and after 30 minutes of procedure, even if at the begining he told me that I had all of the documents requested, I was unable to open my bank account as I was missing a document....seriously???`,
  `The only good thing  was the price. The taste and feel wasn't good at all. Avoid getting they average cakes for a birthday, you'll be disappointed!`,
  `I am very impressed by the food. The pork knuckle with sauerkraut was outstanding. It's skin is super crispy and the fattiness from the pork was well balanced by the sauerkraut. The flavours almost took me back to Germany. The whole dish was quite big in portion which can be easily shared by 3-4 people. The pasta with clams and chrozio was very savoury but a tad too spicy. The waiters were very polite and attentive.`,
  `Trying to escape the  crowd? Look no further than this little cafe at Sofitel and pool ensconced in the tropical forest away from the humidity and heat, providing a cool respite from the searing sun. It is especially breezy and cool in the evening and the entire place is bathed in the glow of the setting sun. The ambience is one of meditative calm that goes well with the spa inspired menu. We had smashed avocado and grilled cheese sandwiches both exquisitely prepared by Chef Jay and served by a most friendly maître d’ Marcus. The scattered seeds and nuts on the smashed avo is like a work of postmodern art, elevating the simple dish to haute cuisine. The grilled cheese comes in a brown bag accompanied by caper berries and onion bulb, the sharp preserves accentuated the three cheeses between the toast… inexplicably delicious and satisfying…`,
